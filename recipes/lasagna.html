        <h2>How to Make Lasagna</h2>
        <p>Making lasagna can be time-consuming, but 
            the results are well worth the wait. 
            You'll find a detailed ingredient list and 
            step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, 
            but let's go over the basics:</p>
        
        <h2>Lasagna Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Meat</strong>: This super meaty 
                lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and 
                lean ground beef.</li>
            <li><strong>Onion and garlic</strong>: An onion 
                and two cloves of garlic are cooked 
                with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Tomato products</strong>: You'll need 
                a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of 
                tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
            <li><strong>Sugar</strong>: Two tablespoons of 
                white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance 
                the flavor of the sauce.</li>
            <li><strong>Spices and seasonings</strong>: This 
                lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh 
                parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, 
                Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, 
                and black pepper.</li>
            <li><strong>Lasagna noodles</strong>: Use 
                store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>
            <li><strong>Cheeses</strong>: Parmesan, 
                mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make 
                this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
            <li><strong>Egg</strong>: An egg helps bind 
                the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of 
                the lasagna when you cut into it.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
          <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic 
            in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</li>
          <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 
            tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 
            2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, 
            Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. 
            Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, 
            stirring occasionally.</li>
          <li>Bring a large pot of lightly 
            salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in 
            boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. 
            Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
          <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with 
            egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 
            teaspoon salt.</li>
          <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
          <li>To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce 
            in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 
            6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, 
            overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the 
            ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the 
            mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups 
            meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle 
            with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
          <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining 
            mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with 
            foil: to prevent sticking, either spray 
            foil with cooking spray or make sure the 
            foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
          <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. 
            Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 
            minutes.</li>
          <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
