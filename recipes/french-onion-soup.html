        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>French onion soup, or soupe à l'oignon gratinée,
            is a classic French dish made with caramelized
            onions and beef stock or broth.
            The soup is topped with bread and cheese, then
            gratinéed to rich, gooey perfection.
            It's traditionally served in a ramekin or
            a ceramic crock with a handle.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>4 cups sliced onions</li>
            <li>5 cups beef broth</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons dry sherry</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>4 slices French bread</li>
            <li>4 slices provolone cheese</li>
            <li>2 slices Swiss cheese, diced</li>
            <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Melt butter with olive oil in an 8-quart 
                stock pot over medium heat. Add onions
            to butter and continually stir until tender
            and translucent. Do not brown the onions.</li>
            <li>Add beef broth, sherry, and thyme. Season
                with salt and pepper. Let simmer for 30 minutes. 
                Meanwhile, preheat the oven's broiler.
            </li>
            <li>Ladle soup into oven-safe serving bowls and 
                place one slice of bread on top of each 
                (bread may be broken into pieces if you prefer). 
                Layer each slice of bread with a slice of 
                provolone, 1/2 slice diced Swiss and 1 
                tablespoon Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Place bowls on a cookie sheet and broil in 
                the preheated oven until cheese bubbles and 
                browns slightly, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
